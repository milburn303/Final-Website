        <h3>I grauated from South Fayette High School in 2016 and initially went to University of Pittsburgh before transferring to University of Tampa. <br> <br> I was initally a music major concentrating in jazz and classical guitar, even serving as the University's jazz pianist for a year. This is a short audio of a piece I arranged for the classical guitar ensemble:<br>
        <audio controls="controls">
          <source src = "media/guitar.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
          <source src = "media/guitar.wav" type="audio/wav">
          <p>This browser does not support this format</P>
        </audio>
        <br> However, I changed my major to management information systems with a minor in business analytics due to my love for data science. <br> <br> These are some relevant course taken during my time in Tampa: <hr><br>
